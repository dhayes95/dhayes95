<h3 style="float:right;">I am a postdoc at the University of Delaware working under Dr. Jingmei Qiu. Recently, 
			   I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Delaware under the advisement of Dr. Constantin Bacuta. My Ph.D. research was focused
			   on finite element methods for steady-state parametric problems exhibiting boundary layers. Currently, my research interests are
			   in the time and storage efficiency of algorithms for numerically approximating partial differential equations.</h3>
