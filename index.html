    		<p>This website is currently under construction This code uses Internet Explorer conditional comments to add a fix for “min-height” only when the site is viewed by an incompatible browser. Due to bugs and earlier poor implementation versions 6 and 8 need this fix. It forces the entire wrapper div to use table-like CSS display rules, then tacks 100 percent height to that.</p>
