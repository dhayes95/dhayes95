			My research focus is in numerical approximations for partial differential equations. During my Ph.D. research, I focused on the development of finite element methods, 
				specifically, saddle point least squares and Petrov-Galerkin formulations for elliptic problems that exhibited boundary layers. The two classes of problems that I
				focused on were reaction-diffusion and convection-diffusion. For these problems, I became familiar with multigrid and multilevel methods for preconditioning purposes. 
				In the convection-diffusion case, I also built familiarity with stabilization methods as this problem is notorious for issues with standard techniques.
