			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>
			My research focus is in numerical approximations for partial differential equations. During my Ph.D. research, I focused on the development of finite element methods, 
				specifically, saddle point least squares and Petrov-Galerkin formulations for elliptic problems that exhibited boundary layers.
